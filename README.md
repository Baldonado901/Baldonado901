- 👋 Hi, I’m @Baldonado901
- 👀 I’m interested in Learning about Pen Testing and coding, Its a slow process for me. Adhd or maybe some other learning disability is really frustrating me. If you have any tips or tricks or to make it easier to learn. Visual learning for anything like coding and pentesting would help. I would love some direction, and it needs to be free. I'm really hurting finacally right now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Penetration Testing and coding ( not grasping coding so focusing on the Pentration Testing for now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not sure. I really am having a hard time learning, I would just like some advice. If you have ADHD or have had a really hard time studying or learning like me and you can share with me what helpped you.
